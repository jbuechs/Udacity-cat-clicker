# Udacity-cat-clicker
A mini-project I have created for Udacity's JavaScript Design Patterns course

##How to Run the Application
You can access the application in a couple of ways:

1. Clone the GitHub repository at hhttps://github.com/jbuechs/Udacity-cat-clicker.git and open the index.html button
2. Go to http://jbuechs.github.io/Udacity-cat-clicker

##What Does it Do?
It's a great application! It counts the number of times you click on a cat. PLUS it has the added bonus of having many cats to choose from.

##What Did I Learn?
This might look like a simple app, and it is. But I spent many hours staring at the screen, trying to debug, and generally having a frustrating time of it. I eventually learned about separating the Model from the View, which made the code and functionality a lot cleaner and more scalable. I also had some difficulty with the click event handlers and I needed to use the code from the solution for the closures. I was oh so close, but couldn't do it all on my own.

However, I would say 98% of this code is my own original work so I'm pretty proud of it!
